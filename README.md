 ## Well hello there 🌌
 
 ### I'm Lissa and I'm a physicist  
 
🏢 I'm currently a research fellow in the University of Pavia, Italy
  
📄 all my papers are available on [ArVix](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Campos%2C+L+d+S&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50) and on [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20Lissa%20de%20Souza%20Campos)
  
✉️ reach me at lissa.desouzacampos@unipv.it

### working on Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetimes

🔮 on the construction of physically-sensible states for free, scalar, massive, quantum fields on static spacetimes
  
🔦 on probing quantum states with Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors
  
📉 on thermal effects of black holes

### and uploading my notebooks here

⌛ the numerical analyses of my papers

🔧 simple Mathematica packages (for personal use) that really simplifies the computations I perform 
  
  
If you have criticisms, doubts, suggestions, or are interested in improving one of these simple packages, making it more professional, or would like to collaborate in the development of a new one, please contact me and we can work on it together 🙂

 ## Well hello there 🌌
 
 ### I'm Lissa and I'm a phd in mathematical physics 
 
🐦 I'm currently in-between stuff

### Here on my github you can find

📉 notebooks with the numerical analyses of my papers

🔧 simple Mathematica packages (for personal use) that really simplified the computations I performed during my phd

🎯 projects I've worked on for personal/professional development or just for fun

### Most of my work on Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetimes is available online
  
📄 my papers are available on [ArVix](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Campos%2C+L+d+S&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50) and on [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20Lissa%20de%20Souza%20Campos)

### Contact me
  
If you have criticisms, doubts, suggestions, or are interested in improving one of these simple packages, making it more professional, or would like to collaborate in the development of a new one, please contact me and we can work on it together 🙂
